A seed for AngularJS apps with lazy loading using requireJS and UI-Router
=====================================
This project is an application skeleton for an [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) app using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) for lazy loading.

It is a fork of the [example](https://github.com/lukeb-uk/angular-requirejs-lazy-load-seed) by lukeb-uk that was created to accompany the blog post entitled
'[Lazy Loading In AngularJS](http://ify.io/lazy-loading-in-angularjs/)'.

This seed project contains [AngularJS 1.0.7](http://angularjs.org/), [jQuery 1.10.2](http://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap 2.3.2](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [RequireJS 2.1.8](http://requirejs.org/), all ready for you to just start hacking away.

In terms of functionality, this seed app doesn't do much. It has 3 pages and shows you how to wire up the individual components of a lazy loading AngularJS app using UI-Router
